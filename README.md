# 🔢 Simple Python Calculator 🧠💥

A no-nonsense, straight-up calculator that handles basic arithmetic like a boss using Python 3's `match-case` swag (Python 3.10+ only, peasants with older versions can cry 💅).

## 💻 Features

- Addition ➕  
- Subtraction ➖  
- Multiplication ✖️  
- Division ➗  
- Handles invalid operators like a bouncer at a club 🍻

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you're on Python 3.10+ (seriously, `match-case` ain’t gonna vibe with old Python).

2. Copy this into a `.py` file (e.g., `calculator.py`).

3. Run the file:

```bash
python calculator.py
